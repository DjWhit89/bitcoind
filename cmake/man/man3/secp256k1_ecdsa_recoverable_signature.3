.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Opaque data structure that holds a parsed ECDSA signature, supporting pubkey recovery\&.

.PP
The exact representation of data inside is implementation defined and not guaranteed to be portable between different platforms or versions\&. It is however guaranteed to be 65 bytes in size, and can be safely copied/moved\&. If you need to convert to a format suitable for storage or transmission, use the secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_serialize_* and secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_parse_* functions\&.

.PP
Furthermore, it is guaranteed that identical signatures (including their recoverability) will have identical representation, so they can be memcmp'ed\&.
