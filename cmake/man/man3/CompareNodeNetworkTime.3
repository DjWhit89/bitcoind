.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Sort eviction candidates by network/localhost and connection uptime\&. Candidates near the beginning are more likely to be evicted, and those near the end are more likely to be protected, e\&.g\&. less likely to be evicted\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
First, nodes that are not \fRis_local\fP and that do not belong to \fRnetwork\fP, sorted by increasing uptime (from most recently connected to connected longer)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Then, nodes that are \fRis_local\fP or belong to \fRnetwork\fP, sorted by increasing uptime\&.
