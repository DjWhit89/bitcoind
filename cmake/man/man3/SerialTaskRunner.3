.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Class used by \fBCScheduler\fP clients which may schedule multiple jobs which are required to be run serially\&. Jobs may not be run on the same thread, but no two jobs will be executed at the same time and memory will be release-acquire consistent (the scheduler will internally do an acquire before invoking a callback as well as a release at the end)\&. In practice this means that a callback \fBB()\fP will be able to observe all of the effects of callback A() which executed before it\&.

.SS "void flush ()\fR [override]\fP, \fR [virtual]\fP"
Processes all remaining queue members on the calling thread, blocking until queue is empty Must be called after the \fBCScheduler\fP has no remaining processing threads! 
.PP
Implements \fBTaskRunnerInterface\fP\&.
.SS "void insert (std::function< void()> func)\fR [override]\fP, \fR [virtual]\fP"
Add a callback to be executed\&. Callbacks are executed serially and memory is release-acquire consistent between callback executions\&. Practically, this means that callbacks can behave as if they are executed in order by a single thread\&.

Implements \fBTaskRunnerInterface\fP\&.
.SS "size_t size ()\fR [override]\fP, \fR [virtual]\fP"
Returns the number of currently pending events\&.
