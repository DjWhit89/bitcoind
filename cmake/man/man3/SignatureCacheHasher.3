.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
We're hashing a nonce into the entries themselves, so we don't need extra blinding in the set hash computation\&.

.PP
This may exhibit platform endian dependent behavior but because these are nonced hashes (random) and this state is only ever used locally it is safe\&. All that matters is local consistency\&.
