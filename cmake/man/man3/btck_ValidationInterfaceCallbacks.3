.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Holds the validation interface callbacks\&. The user data pointer may be used to point to user-defined structures to make processing the validation callbacks easier\&. Note that these callbacks block any further validation execution when they are called\&. 
.SH "Field Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "\fBbtck_ValidationInterfaceBlockChecked\fP block_checked"
Called when a new block has been fully validated\&. Contains the result of its validation\&. 
.SS "\fBbtck_ValidationInterfaceBlockConnected\fP block_connected"

.PP
Called when a block is valid and has now been connected to the best chain\&. 
.SS "\fBbtck_ValidationInterfaceBlockDisconnected\fP block_disconnected"

.PP
Called during a re-org when a block has been removed from the best chain\&. 
.SS "\fBbtck_ValidationInterfacePoWValidBlock\fP pow_valid_block"
Called when a new block extends the header chain and has a valid transaction and segwit merkle root\&. 
.SS "void* user_data"
Holds a user-defined opaque structure that is passed to the validation interface callbacks\&. If user_data_destroy is also defined ownership of the user_data is passed to the created context options and subsequently context\&. 
.SS "\fBbtck_DestroyCallback\fP user_data_destroy"

.PP
Frees the provided user data structure\&.
