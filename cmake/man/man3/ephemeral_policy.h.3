Must be called for each transaction(package) if any dust is in the package\&. Checks that each transaction's parents have their dust spent by the child, where parents are either in the mempool or in the package itself\&. Sets out_child_state and out_child_wtxid on failure\&.

These utility functions ensure that ephemeral dust is safely created and spent without unduly risking them entering the utxo set\&.

.PP
This is ensured by requiring:
.IP "\(bu" 2
PreCheckEphemeralTx checks are respected
.IP "\(bu" 2
The parent has no child (and 0-fee as implied above to disincentivize mining)
.IP "\(bu" 2
OR the parent transaction has exactly one child, and the dust is spent by that child
.PP

.PP
Imagine three transactions: TxA, 0-fee with two outputs, one non-dust, one dust TxB, spends TxA's non-dust TxC, spends TxA's dust

.PP
All the dust is spent if TxA+TxB+TxC is accepted, but the mining template may just pick up TxA+TxB rather than the three "legal configurations": 1) None 2) TxA+TxB+TxC 3) TxA+TxC By requiring the child transaction to sweep any dust from the parent txn, we ensure that there is a single child only, and this child, or the child's descendants, are the only way to bring fees\&. Must be called for each transaction once transaction fees are known\&. Does context-less checks about a single transaction\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
false if the fee is non-zero and dust exists, populating state\&. True otherwise\&.
