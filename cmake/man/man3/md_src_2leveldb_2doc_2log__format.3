md_src_2leveldb_2doc_2log__format \- leveldb Log format 
.PP
The log file contents are a sequence of 32KB blocks\&. The only exception is that the tail of the file may contain a partial block\&.

.PP
Each block consists of a sequence of records: 
.PP
.nf
block := record* trailer?
record :=
  checksum: uint32     // crc32c of type and data[] ; little-endian
  length: uint16       // little-endian
  type: uint8          // One of FULL, FIRST, MIDDLE, LAST
  data: uint8[length]

.fi
.PP

.PP
A record never starts within the last six bytes of a block (since it won't fit)\&. Any leftover bytes here form the trailer, which must consist entirely of zero bytes and must be skipped by readers\&.

.PP
Aside: if exactly seven bytes are left in the current block, and a new non-zero length record is added, the writer must emit a FIRST record (which contains zero bytes of user data) to fill up the trailing seven bytes of the block and then emit all of the user data in subsequent blocks\&.

.PP
More types may be added in the future\&. Some Readers may skip record types they do not understand, others may report that some data was skipped\&. 
.PP
.nf
FULL == 1
FIRST == 2
MIDDLE == 3
LAST == 4

.fi
.PP

.PP
The FULL record contains the contents of an entire user record\&.

.PP
FIRST, MIDDLE, LAST are types used for user records that have been split into multiple fragments (typically because of block boundaries)\&. FIRST is the type of the first fragment of a user record, LAST is the type of the last fragment of a user record, and MIDDLE is the type of all interior fragments of a user record\&.

.PP
Example: consider a sequence of user records: 
.PP
.nf
A: length 1000
B: length 97270
C: length 8000

.fi
.PP

.PP
\fBA\fP will be stored as a FULL record in the first block\&.

.PP
\fBB\fP will be split into three fragments: first fragment occupies the rest of the first block, second fragment occupies the entirety of the second block, and the third fragment occupies a prefix of the third block\&. This will leave six bytes free in the third block, which will be left empty as the trailer\&.

.PP
\fBC\fP will be stored as a FULL record in the fourth block\&.

.SH "Some benefits over the recordio format:"
.PP
.IP "1." 4
We do not need any heuristics for resyncing - just go to next block boundary and scan\&. If there is a corruption, skip to the next block\&. As a side-benefit, we do not get confused when part of the contents of one log file are embedded as a record inside another log file\&.
.IP "2." 4
Splitting at approximate boundaries (e\&.g\&., for mapreduce) is simple: find the next block boundary and skip records until we hit a FULL or FIRST record\&.
.IP "3." 4
We do not need extra buffering for large records\&.
.PP
.SH "Some downsides compared to recordio format:"
.PP
.IP "1." 4
No packing of tiny records\&. This could be fixed by adding a new record type, so it is a shortcoming of the current implementation, not necessarily the format\&.
.IP "2." 4
No compression\&. Again, this could be fixed by adding new record types\&.
