.SS "std::optional<std::string> label"
Address label which is always nullopt for change addresses\&. For sending and receiving addresses, it will be set to an arbitrary label string provided by the user, or to "", which is the default label\&. The presence or absence of a label is used to distinguish change addresses from non-change addresses by wallet transaction listing and fee bumping code\&. 
.SS "bool previously_spent {false}"
Whether coins with this address have previously been spent\&. Set when the the wallet avoid_reuse option is enabled and this is an IsMine address that has already received funds and spent them\&. This is used during coin selection to increase privacy by not creating different transactions that spend from the same addresses\&. 
.SS "std::optional<\fBAddressPurpose\fP> purpose"
Address purpose which was originally recorded for payment protocol support but now serves as a cached IsMine value\&. \fBWallet\fP code should not rely on this field being set\&. 
.SS "std::map<std::string, std::string> receive_requests {}"
Map containing data about previously generated receive requests requesting funds to be sent to this address\&. Only present for IsMine addresses\&. Map keys are decimal numbers uniquely identifying each request, and map values are serialized \fBRecentRequestEntry\fP objects containing BIP21 URI information including message and amount\&.
