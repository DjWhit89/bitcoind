.SS "int64_t ALWAYS_ACTIVE = \-1\fR [static]\fP, \fR [constexpr]\fP"
Special value for nStartTime indicating that the deployment is always active\&. This is useful for testing, as it means tests don't need to deal with the activation process (which takes at least 3 BIP9 intervals)\&. Only tests that specifically test the behaviour during activation cannot use this\&. 
.SS "int bit {28}"
Bit position to select the particular bit in nVersion\&. 
.SS "int min_activation_height {0}"
If lock in occurs, delay activation until at least this block height\&. Note that activation will only occur on a retarget boundary\&. 
.SS "int64_t NEVER_ACTIVE = \-2\fR [static]\fP, \fR [constexpr]\fP"
Special value for nStartTime indicating that the deployment is never active\&. This is useful for integrating the code changes for a new feature prior to deploying it on some or all networks\&. 
.SS "int64_t NO_TIMEOUT = std::numeric_limits<int64_t>::max()\fR [static]\fP, \fR [constexpr]\fP"
Constant for nTimeout very far in the future\&. 
.SS "int64_t nStartTime {\fBNEVER_ACTIVE\fP}"
Start MedianTime for version bits miner confirmation\&. Can be a date in the past 
.SS "int64_t nTimeout {\fBNEVER_ACTIVE\fP}"
Timeout/expiry MedianTime for the deployment attempt\&. 
.SS "uint32_t period {2016}"
Period of blocks to check signalling in (usually retarget period, ie params\&.DifficultyAdjustmentInterval()) 
.SS "uint32_t threshold {1916}"
Minimum blocks including miner confirmation of the total of 2016 blocks in a retargeting period, which is also used for BIP9 deployments\&. Examples: 1916 for 95%, 1512 for testchains\&.
