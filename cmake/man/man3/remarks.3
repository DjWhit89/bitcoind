.PP

.SH "Purpose"
.PP
This header currently exposes an API for interacting with parts of Bitcoin Core's consensus code\&. Users can validate blocks, iterate the block index, read block and undo data from disk, and validate scripts\&. The header is unversioned and not stable yet\&. Users should expect breaking changes\&. It is also not yet included in releases of Bitcoin Core\&.
.SH "Context"
.PP
The library provides a built-in static constant kernel context\&. This static context offers only limited functionality\&. It detects and self-checks the correct \fBsha256\fP implementation, initializes the random number generator and self-checks the secp256k1 static context\&. It is used internally for otherwise "context-free" operations\&. This means that the user is not required to initialize their own context before using the library\&.

.PP
The user should create their own context for passing it to state-rich validation functions and holding callbacks for kernel events\&.
.SH "Error handling"
.PP
Functions communicate an error through their return types, usually returning a nullptr, 0, or false if an error is encountered\&. Additionally, verification functions, e\&.g\&. for scripts, may communicate more detailed error information through status code out parameters\&.

.PP
Fine-grained validation information is communicated through the validation interface\&.

.PP
The kernel notifications issue callbacks for errors\&. These are usually indicative of a system error\&. If such an error is issued, it is recommended to halt and tear down the existing kernel objects\&. Remediating the error may require system intervention by the user\&.
.SH "Pointer and argument conventions"
.PP
The user is responsible for de-allocating the memory owned by pointers returned by functions\&. Typically pointers returned by *_create(\&.\&.\&.) functions can be de-allocated by corresponding *_destroy(\&.\&.\&.) functions\&.

.PP
A function that takes pointer arguments makes no assumptions on their lifetime\&. Once the function returns the user can safely de-allocate the passed in arguments\&.

.PP
Const pointers represent views, and do not transfer ownership\&. Lifetime guarantees of these objects are described in the respective documentation\&. Ownership of these resources may be taken by copying\&. They are typically used for iteration with minimal overhead and require some care by the programmer that their lifetime is not extended beyond that of the original object\&.

.PP
Array lengths follow the pointer argument they describe\&.
