Inherits \fBContext\fP\&.
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Cap'n Proto context struct\&. Generally the parent \fBipc::Context\fP struct should be used instead of this struct to give all IPC protocols access to application state, so there aren't unnecessary differences between IPC protocols\&. But this specialized struct can be used to pass capnp-specific function and object types to capnp hooks\&.
