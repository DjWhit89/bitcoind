Check whether the sequence numbers on this transaction are signaling opt-in to replace-by-fee, according to BIP 125\&. Allow opt-out of transaction replacement by setting nSequence > MAX_BIP125_RBF_SEQUENCE (SEQUENCE_FINAL-2) on all inputs\&.

.PP
SEQUENCE_FINAL-1 is picked to still allow use of nLockTime by non-replaceable transactions\&. All inputs rather than just one is for the sake of multi-party protocols, where we don't want a single party to be able to disable replacement by opting out in their own input\&.
