.SS "\fBCAmount\fP fee_threshold {MAX_MONEY}"
The wait method will not return a new template unless it has fees at least fee_threshold sats higher than the current template, or unless the chain tip changes and the previous template is no longer valid\&.

.PP
A caller may not be interested in templates with higher fees, and determining whether fee_threshold is reached is also expensive\&. So as an optimization, when fee_threshold is set to MAX_MONEY (default), the implementation is able to be much more efficient, skipping expensive checks and only returning new templates when the chain tip changes\&. 
.SS "\fBMillisecondsDouble\fP timeout {MillisecondsDouble::max()}"
How long to wait before returning nullptr instead of a new template\&. Default is to wait forever\&.
