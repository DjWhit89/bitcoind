.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Holds configuration for use during UTXO snapshot load and validation\&. The contents here are security critical, since they dictate which UTXO snapshots are recognized as valid\&. 
.SH "Field Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "\fBuint256\fP blockhash"
The hash of the base block for this snapshot\&. Used to refer to assumeutxo data prior to having a loaded blockindex\&. 
.SS "\fBAssumeutxoHash\fP hash_serialized"

.PP
The expected hash of the deserialized UTXO set\&. 
.SS "int height"

.SS "uint64_t m_chain_tx_count"
Used to populate the m_chain_tx_count value, which is used during BlockManager::LoadBlockIndex()\&.

.PP
We need to hardcode the value here because this is computed cumulatively using block data, which we do not necessarily have at the time of snapshot load\&.
