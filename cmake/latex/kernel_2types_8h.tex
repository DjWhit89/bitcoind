\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
is a home for simple enum and struct type definitions that can be used internally by functions in the libbitcoin\+\_\+kernel library, but also used externally by node, wallet, and GUI code.

This file is intended to define only simple types that do not have external dependencies. More complicated types should be defined in dedicated header files.
