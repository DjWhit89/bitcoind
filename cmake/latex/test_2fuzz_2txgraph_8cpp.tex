FUZZ\+\_\+\+TARGET (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{txgraph}]{}{}\end{DoxyParamCaption})}

Internal test RNG, used only for decisions which would require significant amount of data to be read from the provider, without realistically impacting test sensitivity, and for specialized test cases that are hard to perform more generically.

Variable used whenever an empty \doxyref{Tx\+Graph\+::\+Ref}{p.}{class_tx_graph_1_1_ref} is needed.

The maximum number of transactions per (non-\/oversized) cluster we will use in this simulation.

The maximum total size of transactions in a (non-\/oversized) cluster.

The number of iterations to consider a cluster acceptably linearized.

Struct encapsulating information about a Block\+Builder that\textquotesingle{}s currently live.

Block\+Builder object from real.

The set of transactions marked as included in $\ast$builder.

The set of transactions marked as included or skipped in $\ast$builder.

The last chunk feerate returned by $\ast$builder. Is\+Empty() if none yet.

Currently active block builders.

Function to pick any Ref (for either sim in sims\+: from sim.\+simmap or sim.\+removed, or the empty Ref).

The number of possible choices.

Pick one of them.

Function to construct the correct fee-\/size diagram a real graph has based on its graph order (as reported by Get\+Cluster(), so it works for both main and staging).

Use the bottom 2 bits of command to select an entry in the block\+\_\+builders vector (if any). These use the same bits as alt/level\+\_\+select, so don\textquotesingle{}t use those in actions below where builder\+\_\+idx is used as well.
