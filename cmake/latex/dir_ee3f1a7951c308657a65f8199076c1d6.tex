The following interfaces are defined here\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{{\ttfamily Chain}}} — used by wallet to access blockchain and mempool state. Added in {\texttt{\#14437}}, {\texttt{\#14711}}, {\texttt{\#15288}}, and {\texttt{\#10973}}.
\item {\texttt{{\ttfamily Chain\+Client}}} — used by node to start \& stop {\ttfamily \doxyref{Chain}{p.}{class_chain}} clients. Added in {\texttt{\#14437}}.
\item {\texttt{{\ttfamily Node}}} — used by GUI to start \& stop bitcoin node. Added in {\texttt{\#10244}}.
\item {\texttt{{\ttfamily Wallet}}} — used by GUI to access wallets. Added in {\texttt{\#10244}}.
\item {\texttt{{\ttfamily Handler}}} — returned by {\ttfamily handle\+Event} methods on interfaces above and used to manage lifetimes of event handlers.
\item {\texttt{{\ttfamily Init}}} — used by multiprocess code to access interfaces above on startup. Added in {\texttt{\#19160}}.
\item {\texttt{{\ttfamily Ipc}}} — used by multiprocess code to access {\ttfamily \doxyref{Init}{p.}{class_init}} interface across processes. Added in {\texttt{\#19160}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The interfaces above define boundaries between major components of bitcoin code (node, wallet, and gui), making it possible for them to run in different processes, and be tested, developed, and understood independently. These interfaces are not currently designed to be stable or to be used externally.
