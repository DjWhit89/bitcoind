\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Dummy data type to identify deserializing constructors.

By convention, a constructor of a type T with signature

template $<$typename Stream$>$ T\+::\+T(deserialize\+\_\+type, Stream\& s)

is a deserializing constructor, which builds the type by deserializing it from s. If T contains const fields, this is likely the only way to do so. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
src/\textbf{ serialize.\+h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
