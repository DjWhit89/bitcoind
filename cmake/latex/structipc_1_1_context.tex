\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\doxyref{Context}{p.}{structipc_1_1_context} struct used to give IPC protocol implementations or implementation hooks access to application state, in case they need to run extra code that isn\textquotesingle{}t needed within a single process, like code copying global state from an existing process to a new process when it\textquotesingle{}s initialized, or code dealing with shared objects that are created or destroyed remotely. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
src/ipc/\textbf{ context.\+h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
